## Overview

x402scan is a **community-driven ecosystem explorer** for the x402 protocol.

It aims to provide **analytics and tools** that **enhance visibility** and **foster adoption** of x402 as the standard for agentic commerce.

## What is x402?

x402 is a new open payment protocol developed by Coinbase that enables instant, automatic stablecoin payments directly over HTTP.

The protocol allows the monetization of APIs and digital content, allowing humans and machines to pay for access without accounts, sessions, or authentication.

## Why Did We Build x402scan?

We believe that x402 is the future of agentic commerce. The protocol is gaining traction, and we want to provide visibility into its growth. Today, you can:

- View and analyze ecosystem-wide transaction, volume, merchant, and buyer data
- Explore and invoke x402-compatible resources
- Track facilitator usage and their transaction volumes
- See the latest transactions and their details

## What's Next?

We're working on adding more features to x402scan, including:

- Multi-chain support
- Agent builder with composable x402 tools
- Reputation and performance metrics for resources
- Resource app store
