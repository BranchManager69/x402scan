## Overview

**Resources** are endpoints protected by x402 that can be invoked by clients. Some examples include:

- A search API endpoint
- An agent that fixes bugs on a GitHub repository
- An OCR service that extracts text and images from a PDF

## Resource x402 Response

When a resource is invoked without a payment header, it returns a 402 Payment Required response with instructions on how to pay.

The response spec defined by the x402 protocol is listed in the [x402 Overview](/docs/x402#x402-response) page.

## Adding Resources

<Card className="border rounded-md overflow-hidden">
  <video controls width="100%" className="my-0!">
    <source src="/docs/add-resource.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</Card>

If an x402 resource you know if is not listed on x402scan, you can register it [here](https://x402.xyz/resources/register).

When you register a resource, we will ping the endpoint and validate the response.

### Listed Resources

For the resource to be listed on the dashboard, it must provide a valid x402 response as listed above.

### Invokable Resources

For the resource to be available for use, it must provide a valid enhanced output schema as listed below.

## Enhanced Output Schema

The x402 spec leaves the `outputSchema` field open-ended and does not enforce a schema.

We enforce a stricter schema to allow users to invoke resources from within the app:

<div className="border rounded-md overflow-hidden p-0!">
  <Image
    src="/docs/resource.png"
    alt="Enhanced Output Schema"
    width={1200}
    height={630}
    className="my-0!"
  />
</div>

The schema we enforce for `response.accepts[number].outputSchema` is defined as follows:

```ts
type EnhancedOutputSchema = {
  input: {
    type: 'http';
    method: 'GET' | 'POST';
    bodyType?: 'json';
    queryParams?: Record<string, FieldDef>;
    bodyFields?: Record<string, FieldDef>;
    headerFields?: Record<string, FieldDef>;
  };
  output?: Record<string, any>;
};

type FieldDef = {
  type?: string;
  required?: boolean | string[];
  description?: string;
  enum?: string[];
  properties?: Record<string, FieldDef>; // for nested objects
};
```
