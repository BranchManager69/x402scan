import { DatabaseSchema } from '../../components/database-schema';

## Database Schema

We maintain a database of resources, payment schemes, and resource origins to provide semantic labels to x402 transactions.

<DatabaseSchema />

## Ingestion Pipeline

Our data is populated from two sources:

1. Sync from facilitators that support the `/discovery/resources` endpoint every minute
2. Fetch resources provided by users from the [Register Resources](https://x402.xyz/resources/register) page. Read more about registering resources [here](https://x402.xyz/resources/register).
